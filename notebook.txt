Machine Learning
	Building Your Model
		The steps to building and using a model are:
		1.Define: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
		2.Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
		3.Predict: Just what it sounds like
		4.Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are
	
	Underfitting & Overfitting
		Overfitting - Tree depth is too large, only a few of training data in each leaf causing unreliable predictions on new data
		Underfitting - Tree depth is too shallow, too large volume of training data in each leaf causing failure in capturing important distictions and patterns on data
